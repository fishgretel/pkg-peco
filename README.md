# :black_circle: [_peco_](https://github.com/peco/peco)
> peco (pronounced peh-koh) is based on a python tool, percol. percol was darn useful, but I wanted a tool that was a single binary, and forget about python.

Peco package for [Wahoo][Wahoo] / [fish](fishshell.com).

## Install
> _Note_: You need to have `peco` installed prior to loading Wahoo.

```fish
wa g peco
```

If not yet installed `peco` can be installed using `homebrew`:

```fish
brew install peco
```
